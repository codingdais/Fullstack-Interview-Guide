Certainly! Here's a list of frequently asked object coding problems in JavaScript interviews:

1. Create an object and access its properties.
2. Add a new property to an existing object.
3. Remove a property from an object.
4. Check if a property exists in an object.
5. Iterate over the properties of an object.
6. Clone or copy an object.
7. Merge two or more objects into a single object.
8. Find the length or size of an object (number of properties).
9. Check if two objects are equal.
10. Convert an object to an array of key-value pairs.
11. Check if an object is empty (contains no properties).
12. Get all values of an object as an array.
13. Get all keys of an object as an array.
14. Create an object using a constructor function or class.
15. Check if an object is an instance of a specific class or constructor function.
16. Check if an object has a specific prototype in its prototype chain.
17. Get the prototype of an object.
18. Add a method to an existing object.
19. Compare two objects for deep equality.
20. Freeze an object (make it read-only).
21. Prevent extensions to an object (make it non-extensible).
22. Seal an object (prevent adding or removing properties, but allow modifying existing ones).
23. Convert an object to a JSON string.
24. Parse a JSON string to create an object.
25. Check if an object has a specific property with a specific value.
26. Serialize an object to a query string format.
27. Deserialize a query string to create an object.
28. Perform a shallow copy or deep copy of an object.
29. Retrieve a nested property from an object using dot notation or bracket notation.
30. Merge nested objects into a single object (deep merge).
31. Convert an object's keys to camelCase or snake_case format.
32. Convert an object's values to uppercase or lowercase.
33. Sort the properties of an object alphabetically.
34. Find the maximum or minimum value of a property in an array of objects.
35. Group objects by a specific property value.
36. Calculate the total or average of a numeric property in an array of objects.
37. Find objects that satisfy a specific condition in an array of objects.
38. Remove duplicate objects from an array of objects based on a property value.
39. Map or transform an array of objects to a new array of objects.
40. Filter an array of objects based on a condition.
41. Sort an array of objects based on a specific property.
42. Perform pagination on an array of objects.
43. Find the object with the highest or lowest value of a specific property.
44. Remove an object from an array of objects based on a property value.
45. Calculate the sum, average, or count of a property in an array of objects grouped by another property.
46. Find the index of an object in an array of objects based on a property value.
47. Remove properties with null or undefined values from an object.
48. Find the object with the most occurrences in an array of objects.
49. Convert an object to a Map or vice versa.
50. Find the objects with the maximum or minimum value of a specific property in an array of objects.

These are just a few examples, and there are many more object-related problems that can be asked in interviews. It's important to have a good understanding of JavaScript objects and their manipulation techniques to tackle these types of problems effectively.
