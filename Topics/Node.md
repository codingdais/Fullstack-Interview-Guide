# process nextTick (. and setImmediate (.?

- process. nextTick(. is used to schedule a callback function to be invoked in the next iteration of the Event Loop. setImmediate(. method is used to execute a function right after the current event loop finishes

#

# > NodeJS Application Secure

1. Validation of incoming JSON Schemas - joi or Jsonschema
2. Query Injections Validation - SQL Injection is one of the most popular attacks. During SQL injections, attackers execute SQL statements on the database
3. Cross-Site Scripting Attacks
4. Strong Authentication - “Okta” or “OAuth”, library -> Bcrypt” or “Scrypt”.
5. Limiting the wrong login attempts.
6. Errors should not reveal all information
   - you should wind up it with the “catch” clause.
7. Execute Automatic Vulnerability Scanning
8. Remove Data Leaks
9. authentication vs authorization



1. Why is middleware needed?

Middleware is required for helping developers in building applications more effectively and efficiently. The middleware will act as a connection between data, applications, and the users. When you are an organization with a multi-cloud environment, then middleware will make it more cost-effective for the development and running of the application at scale.

2. What is middleware in Node.js?

The middleware in node.js is a function that will have all the access for requesting an object, responding to an object, and moving to the next middleware function in the application request-response cycle. This function can be used for modifying the req and res objects for tasks like adding response headers, parsing requesting bodies, and so on.

3. What is Express middleware?
   Middleware is an abstraction layer that works as an intermediate between the software layers. Express middleware is a function that is compiled during the lifecycle of the Express server. There is always a competition between Express and Koa for better middleware.
