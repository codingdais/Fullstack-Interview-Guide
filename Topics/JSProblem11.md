# Questions

1. Diff between let and const, var - scope, defination, decleration?
2. Diff between ES5 and ES6?
4. asynchronias call how js handle?
5. What is clouser

     - Function bundled with its lexical environment is known as a closure.
        - Whenever function is returned, even if its vanished in execution context but still it remembers the reference it was pointing to. Its not just that function alone it returns but the entire closure
        - A closure is the combination of a function bundled together (enclosed) with references to its surrounding state (the lexical environment).

        - A clouser gives access to outer function scope from an inner function, js clousers are created everytime a function is created.

        ```js1
        function x() {
          var a = 9;
          function y() {
            console.log(a);
          }
          return y;
        }
        var z = x();
        console.log(z);
        ```

        # uses

            - Module design pattern
            - Currying function
            - Function like once -> fun only ren once
            - memoize
            - maintaining state in async world
            - setTimeouts
            - Iterators
            
2. What is callback
3. What is callback hell
4. What is Promies
5. What is Async/await
6. Diff between promise vs Async/await
7. What is Event loop

6.  Carring function

    - Currying is the process of taking a function with multiple arguments and turning it into a sequence of functions each with only a single argument

    - f(a, b, c) —> f(a) => g(b) => h(c)
    - const add = (x) => (y) => x + y;
    - add(10)(20); // 30

7.  First class function, composition
8.  Flat map
9.  Observer vs Promises
23. 
10. what is shaddowing in js
11. EventCapture, eventBublling, eventPreventDefault, stopPropogation, stopImmediatePropagation
15. What is Debouncing and Throtelling
12. Anync vs defr ,
13. Arrow function vs normal function
14. What is Housting
16. Spread vs Createobject defference
17. Global Execution context
18. Shallow copy and Deep copy.
19. Week map and week set
20. Diffreence between map and object.
21. service worker
22. Tamporary Dead Zone

    - TDZ is the time between the let variable was hoisted till it is initilize some value
    - when ever we try to access a variable in TDZ we recive an error.
    - Let and const are TDZ
12. call, bind, apply


23. ## SyntaxError vs ReferenceError vs TypeError

- ReferenceError - > when try to a variable before we initilize it
- SyntaxError -> Re-declear a const variable, x has already been declared and const without initilation
- TypeError -> Assignment to constant variable

23. ## BLOCK SCOPE, Laxical Environment
    - Is defined by {} cully bracess , its combine multiple js statement in one group
    -
    # Laxical Environment
        - Laxical env is local memory along with laxical Env of its parents. it's a hairarkey or chain of scope
24. Shadowing in js
    - if we have same name variable outside the block then block variable will replace global variable value


# Questions:

0. What is the difference between null and undefined in #javascript?
   Lets find out

# null:

It means empty or a value which never existed and means nothing.
type: null is an object.
console. log(typeof null) // object
Code:
let a=null
console. log(a) //null

# undefined:

It means a variable is defined but its value is never initialized.
type: undefined is of type undefined.
console. log(typeof undefined) // undefined
Code:
let a
console. log(a) // undefined

# When to use null object?

# When you have declared an object and want it to be empty initialise it with null.

# Can we assign undefined to variable?

You can assign undefined to any variable but generally its not recommended. If you want to explicitly make any object not available use null instead . Javascript has provided null keyword for the same purpose. Undefined is assigned by javascript when you forget to initialise.

- Event bubbling
  - When an event happens on an element, it first runs the handlers on it, then on its parent, then all the way up on other ancestors.
- Closures
- Function currying
