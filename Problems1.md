# Remove all the negative numbers and split the odd numbers into an even number and a 1
    - [5, 4, -3, 20, 17, -33, -4, 18]

# flatten the array
    = [1, 2, [3, 10, [11, 12]], [1, 2, [3, 4]], 5, 6];


    
Mostly asked JavaScript interview questions!!

1. Reverse a string: Write a function that takes a string as input and returns the string in reverse order. For example, if the input is "Hello, World!", the output should be "!dlroW ,olleH".

2. Find the largest number in an array:  Write a function that takes an array of numbers as input and returns the largest number in the array. For example, if the input is [3, 8, 2, 10, 5], the output should be 10.

3. Check for Palindrome: Write a function that takes a string as input and checks if it is a palindrome. A palindrome is a word or phrase that reads the same forwards and backwards. For example, if the input is "level", the output should be true.

4. FizzBuzz: Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three, print "Fizz" instead of the number, and for the multiples of five, print "Buzz". For numbers that are multiples of both three and five, print "FizzBuzz".

5. Find the missing number: Given an array of numbers from 1 to N, where one number is missing, write a function to find the missing number. For example, if the input is [1, 2, 4, 5, 6], the output should be 3.

6. Remove duplicates from an array: Write a function that takes an array as input and returns a new array with duplicate elements removed. For example, if the input is [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5], the output should be [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].

7. Check for Anagrams: Write a function that takes two strings as input and checks if they are anagrams. Anagrams are two words or phrases that use the same letters in a different order. For example, if the inputs are "listen" and "silent", the output should be true.

8. Find the longest word: Write a function that takes a sentence as input and returns the longest word in the sentence. For example, if the input is "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog", the output should be "jumps".

9. Check for Prime Number: Write a function that takes a number as input and checks if it is a prime number. A prime number is a number that is only divisible by 1 and itself. For example, if the input is 7, the output should be true.

10. Count the occurrences of a character in a string: Write a function that takes a string and a character as input and returns the number of times the character appears in the string. For example, if the input is "hello", "l" the output should be 2.    


# Certainly! Here are various array manipulation techniques commonly used to solve array-related problems:

1. Iteration: Traverse the array using loops (e.g., for loop, while loop) to access and manipulate each element.

2. Accessing Elements: Access individual elements in an array using their index (e.g., `arr[index]`).

3. Adding Elements:
   - Push: Add an element to the end of an array using the `push()` method.
   - Unshift: Add an element to the beginning of an array using the `unshift()` method.
   - Splice: Add or insert elements at a specific position in an array using the `splice()` method.

4. Removing Elements:
   - Pop: Remove the last element from an array using the `pop()` method.
   - Shift: Remove the first element from an array using the `shift()` method.
   - Splice: Remove elements from a specific position in an array using the `splice()` method.

5. Reversing an Array: Reverse the order of elements in an array using the `reverse()` method.

6. Sorting an Array:
   - Sort: Sort an array in ascending order using the `sort()` method.
   - Custom Sorting: Implement a custom sorting logic using the `sort()` method with a compare function.

7. Filtering an Array: Create a new array containing only elements that satisfy a given condition using methods like `filter()` or a loop.

8. Mapping an Array: Create a new array by performing a transformation or operation on each element of the original array using the `map()` method or a loop.

9. Reducing an Array: Reduce an array to a single value by applying an operation on each element and accumulating the result using the `reduce()` method or a loop.

10. Finding Elements:
    - Find: Find the first element in an array that satisfies a given condition using the `find()` method or a loop.
    - FindIndex: Find the index of the first element in an array that satisfies a given condition using the `findIndex()` method or a loop.

11. Slicing an Array: Extract a portion of an array into a new array using the `slice()` method.

12. Concatenating Arrays: Combine two or more arrays into a single array using the `concat()` method.

13. Checking Array Contents:
    - Includes: Check if an array contains a specific element using the `includes()` method or a loop.
    - Every: Check if every element in an array satisfies a given condition using the `every()` method or a loop.
    - Some: Check if at least one element in an array satisfies a given condition using the `some()` method or a loop.

14. Transforming an Array:
    - Join: Convert an array into a string by joining its elements with a specified separator using the `join()` method.
    - toString: Convert an array into a string using the `toString()` method.

15. Copying an Array:
    - Spread Operator: Create a shallow copy of an array using the spread operator (`[...arr]`).
    - Slice: Create a shallow copy of an array using the `slice()` method.

These techniques provide a foundation for manipulating arrays effectively and can be combined creatively to solve various array-related problems.
